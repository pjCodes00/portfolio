# weatherapp-GreatStack 


This project is a weather application app built using HTML,CSS and JAVASCRIPT. This project is originally created by a SoftWare Developer known as GreatStack(Avinash). I followed his tutorial to better understand how to work with APIs and build interactive web apps. Here is the tutorial I used from GreatStack to make these projects:

The app uses the *OpenWeatherMap API* to fetch and display real-time weather data, including: Temperature, Weather condition, Humidity and Wind speed. Users can enter a city name to get the current weather details for that location.

I've also created a step-by-step user tutorial to guide you through on how to use this app.

Technologies I Used to build this app include: HTML, CSS, JavaScript and OpenWeatherMap API(https://openweathermap.org/).

This project helped me apply everything I’ve learned from tutorials on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I used GreatStack’s tutorial as a guide, and I did my own debugging and research whenever I ran into issues. It was a great way to reinforce my front-end development skills.
