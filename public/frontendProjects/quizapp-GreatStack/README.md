This project is a Quizz app built using HTML,CSS and JAVASCRIPT. This project is originally created by a SoftWare Developer known as GreatStack(Avinash). I followed his tutorial to better understand how to work with APIs and build interactive web apps. Here is the tutorial I used from GreatStack to make these projects:

This quiz app allows users to answer multiple-choice questions, each with four answer options. When a user selects an answer:
1.If the answer is correct, the selected button turns green.
2.If the answer is incorrect, it turns red.

Once an answer is selected, it cannot be changed. The user must click Next to proceed to the following question.
After answering the final question and clicking the Next button, the app will automatically display the user's final score based on the number of correct answers.

I've also created a step-by-step user tutorial to guide you through on how to use this app.

This project demonstrates basic DOM manipulation and event handling in Javascript.

Technologies I Used to build this app include: HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

This project helped me apply everything I’ve learned from tutorials on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I used GreatStack’s tutorial as a guide and created my own user tutorial to help others understand how to use the app. I also did my own debugging and research whenever I ran into issues. It was a great way to reinforce my front-end development skills.
