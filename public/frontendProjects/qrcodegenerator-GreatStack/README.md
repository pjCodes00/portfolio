This project is a QR Code Generator app built using HTML,CSS and JAVASCRIPT. This project is originally created by a SoftWare Developer known as GreatStack(Avinash). I followed his tutorial to better understand how to work with APIs and build interactive web apps. Here is the tutorial I used from GreatStack to make these projects:

 This app consists of QR Code Generator built using a free API from: https://goqr.me/api/
 The app will include a button that, when clicked, generates a QR code for any text or link you enter. The generated QR code will be displayed as an image that you can easily use.

I've also created a step-by-step user tutorial to guide you through on how to use this app.

This project demonstrates basic DOM manipulation, event handling in Javascript.

Technologies I Used to build this app include: HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

This project helped me apply everything I’ve learned from tutorials on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I used GreatStack’s tutorial as a guide and created my own user tutorial to help others understand how to use the app. I also did my own debugging and research whenever I ran into issues. It was a great way to reinforce my front-end development skills.
