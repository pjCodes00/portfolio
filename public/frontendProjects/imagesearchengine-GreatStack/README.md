This project is a image search engine app built using HTML,CSS and JAVASCRIPT. This project is originally created by a SoftWare Developer known as GreatStack(Avinash). I followed his tutorial to better understand how to work with APIs and build interactive web apps. Here is the tutorial I used from GreatStack to make these projects:

This website features an image search engine. When a name is typed into the search box and the search button is clicked, it displays a list of images. A "Show More" button allows users to load additional images. The images are fetched using the Unsplash API: https://unsplash.com/

I've also created a step-by-step user tutorial to guide you through on how to use this app.

This project demonstrates basic DOM manipulation, event handling in Javascript.

Technologies I Used to build this app include: HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

This project helped me apply everything I’ve learned from tutorials on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I used GreatStack’s tutorial as a guide and created my own user tutorial to help others understand how to use the app. I also did my own debugging and research whenever I ran into issues. It was a great way to reinforce my front-end development skills.
