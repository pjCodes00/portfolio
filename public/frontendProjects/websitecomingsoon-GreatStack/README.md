This project is a coming soon website built using HTML,CSS and JAVASCRIPT. This project is originally created by a SoftWare Developer known as GreatStack(Avinash). I followed his tutorial to better understand how to work with APIs and build interactive web apps. Here is the tutorial I used from GreatStack to make these projects:

This website features a live countdown timer that updates every second, displaying the days, hours, minutes, and seconds remaining until the site launch. It also includes a CSS-animated rocket image to enhance the visual experience.

This project demonstrates basic DOM manipulation, CSS animations in Javascript, CSS.

Technologies I Used to build this app include: HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

This project helped me apply everything I’ve learned from tutorials on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I used GreatStack’s tutorial as a guide and created my own user tutorial to help others understand how to use the app. I also did my own debugging and research whenever I ran into issues. It was a great way to reinforce my front-end development skills.
