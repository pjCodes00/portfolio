This project is a age calculator app built using HTML,CSS and JAVASCRIPT. This project is originally created by a SoftWare Developer known as GreatStack(Avinash). I followed his tutorial to better understand how to work with APIs and build interactive web apps. Here is the tutorial I used from GreatStack to make these projects:

 This app has an input box with a calendar to select the date of birth. After choosing the date, simply click the "Calculate" button, and the app will display the user's exact age in years, months, and days as of today.

I've also created a step-by-step user tutorial to guide you through on how to use this app.

This project demonstrates basic DOM manipulation, event handling in Javascript.

Technologies I Used to build this app include: HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

This project helped me apply everything I’ve learned from tutorials on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I used GreatStack’s tutorial as a guide and created my own user tutorial to help others understand how to use the app. I also did my own debugging and research whenever I ran into issues. It was a great way to reinforce my front-end development skills.
