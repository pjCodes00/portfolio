This project is a To-do List app built using HTML,CSS and JAVASCRIPT. This project is originally created by a SoftWare Developer known as GreatStack(Avinash). I followed his tutorial to better understand how to work with APIs and build interactive web apps. Here is the tutorial I used from GreatStack to make these projects:

This simple and interactive To-Do List allows you to manage your daily tasks with ease. You can add new tasks using the input box and click the "Add" button to include them in your list. Features in this app include: 
1.Type a new task and add it to your list instantly. 
2.Click on a task checkbox to toggle its completion status.
3.Use the close (x) icon to remove tasks individually.
4.Tasks are saved using Local Storage, so even if you refresh or close the browser, your list will remain intact.

I've also created a step-by-step user tutorial to guide you through on how to use this app.

This project demonstrates basic DOM manipulation, event handling, and the use of Local Storage in JavaScript.

Technologies I Used to build this app include: HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

This project helped me apply everything I’ve learned from tutorials on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I used GreatStack’s tutorial as a guide and created my own user tutorial to help others understand how to use the app. I also did my own debugging and research whenever I ran into issues. It was a great way to reinforce my front-end development skills.
